# MIDSX (Monte Carlo Interactions and Dosage Simulation of X-rays)
MIDSX is a code system for simulating the propagation of X-rays through a medium. Using [EPDL](https://www-nds.iaea.org/epics/) and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-mass-attenuation-coefficients) datasets, it samples photon free paths and interactions to propagate photons through a computational domain of specified dimensions and geometries. Geometries/bodies are defined using the [NIfTI-1 Data Format](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1), which are specified in .domain JSON files. To extract results from a simulation, both Volume and Surface tallies with specifiable measurable quantities and geometries are available, along with derived quantities, such as air kerma for HVL measurements. The following project is a **WIP**, so documentation is currently not available, but it is in the works.
